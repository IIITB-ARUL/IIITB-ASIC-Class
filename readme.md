<details><summary>Introduction to verilog RTL Design and Synthesis</summary>

Register Transfer Logic is a representation of the digital circuit at an abstract level.At the RTL level, designers describe the behavior and functionality of a digital system using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog.

**Simulator:**


**Testbench:**

The functionality of the design block can be tested by applying **stimulus** and checking results.The stimulus block is called as testbench.


![Testbench](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/ddc87d0b-32cc-405d-938b-0b17be79d182)


**Working of Simulator:**


**Introduction to opensource simulator iverilog:**


**Environment Setup:**

Here  we will look into toolflow setup and files setup which are needed to run the lab.
Create a directory named VLSI and git clone(make a clone or copy of files repo at in a new directory to a local machine) the necessary files:

```
mkdir VLSI
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/vsdflow.git
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```

Once you run the commands the corresponding directories will be created.To navigate through the directories and view the  cloned files use the commands shown in the following image.


![Navigate](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/f4175d80-dab8-4911-9975-0db0b1870d5b)


In this section we will first focus on the simulation of the design using **iverilog**.You can see the design files or source files and testbench files in the above image which we are going to use in this lab.


**Working with iverilog and gtkwave:**

Now we are going to load the design file and testbench file in iverilog.To access the file and to simulate it you should move to the **verilog_files** directories as showed in the previous image.

**Simulation:**

We shall compile a 2:1 mux by loading a design file named good_mux.v and its associated testbench file tb_good_mux.v by using the following command:

```
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```
Now an executable file is created.By executing it(using below command),It will dump a vcd file as you can clearly see in the below image:

```
./aout
```

![Screenshot from 2023-08-09 01-51-42](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/dae54b81-6e1d-4cfc-89da-a44403cf90c2)


Now to view the waveform use the following command:

```
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

![Screenshot from 2023-08-09 01-59-36](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/77c9550e-071a-45f5-ab1c-dee7b7ba2088)

To access and edit the module file,use the following command:

```
gvim tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v
```

**Introduction to  Yosys and logic synthesis:**

Yosys is an open-source software framework for RTL synthesis and formal verification of digital designs.

**Synthesis:**

 It is the process of converting the high-level description into an RTL representation that defines the functional blocks, interconnections, and register transfers within the design. This representation is often in the form of a hardware netlist, which is a list of interconnected logic elements.
 During synthesis, various optimization techniques are applied to improve the design's performance, power efficiency, and area utilization.
 
 The first step synthesizer is going to do is a syntactical check then it will start mapping the design.
 **Example:**

![Synthesis example](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/28825050-136b-4778-975e-f23e4b550558)


The conversion of RTL in terms of the standard cells  gates available in the **.lib**.

1.Module maps to the top level ports of the design.

2.The assign statement becomes the mux.

3.The always block  becomes the flipflop.


    
**What is .lib?**

.lib file is a collection of logical modules which includes all basic logic gates. It also contains different flavors of the same gate (2 input AND, 3 input AND â€“ slow, medium and fast version).
This gates will be more than sufficient to form any logical function.

**Purpose of slower cells and faster cells:**



**Introduction to Yosys lab:**

**Steps for Synthesis:**
Move to the directory verilog_files and invoke yosys:

```
cd VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/
yosys
```


![invoke](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/30eeeaaf-14d5-44f0-95f1-be26863eff23)


Now to read the library and design files,give the following cmmand in the yosys prompt:

```
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog good_mux.v
```


![readlib](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/2f487b4b-551d-408a-9216-adb8706d33f5)


Synthesize the module using command:

*synt -top <name.v>*

Here we will synthesize a mux,

```
synth -top good_mux.v
```

**Note:** If the design is spanning more than one  file append remaining file names to the above command.

![Synth](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/afe0511e-123f-4696-8832-486a97745218)

**abc command:** 

This command converts our RTL file into set of gates,i.e., the logic of good_mux is realized in terms of standard cell gates available in the **sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib** library.

Generate netlist:

```
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

![abc](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/3b297d30-2e31-4170-a4ef-6569682c311f)


It also infers number of inputs and outputs in the design.


**show command:**

It is  used to see the logic the synthesizer has realized.It will show the graphical version of logic it has realized.

```
show
```

## Day 2
<details> <summary> Introduction to timing.libs

</summary>


**.lib files:**


To view the contents present in the library file,give the following commands:

```
gvim ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

**sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80:**

*sky denotes skywater,the name of library.*

*tt denotes typical(libraries can be fast slow typical).*

*025C denotes temperature.*

*1v80 denotes voltage.*


![lib](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/727802ee-c8f1-4c90-8719-fdc2d8d1a5fc)

There are three very important parameters which have have to be taken into consideration seriously for the design to work desirably:

1.Process

2.Voltage 

3.Temparature



**Process:**

This refers to the natural variability that occurs during the semiconductor manufacturing process. Process variation can lead to differences in transistor performance, gate delays, and other electrical properties.

**Voltage:**

Voltage variations or supply voltage fluctuations can impact the performance of digital circuits. If the supply voltage deviates from the expected value, it can affect the threshold voltages of transistors, leading to changes in the propagation delays and power consumption of the circuit.


**Temaparature:**

Temperature variations can also influence the behavior of digital circuits. Higher temperatures can cause transistors to become more leaky, leading to increased power consumption and potentially affecting the timing behavior of the circuit.


Our libraries will be characterized to model these **PVT** variations.

**.lib is a  bucket of all the standard cells**.So to highlight the begining of the cell definition use the below keyword:

```
:se hls
```


![cell highlight ](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/d0e761ff-a10d-4479-a40e-5e7f1c017667)


To see the different flavours of the same cells and different cells:

```
:g//
```



![diff cells](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/cf777ebd-5466-4680-839d-dbf0ddd26376)



To understand the functionality:

.lib is going to contain different features of cell.To understand the characteristics of the cell we can look at the equivalent verilog model.

Proceed with the following keyword in the library file:

```
sp ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v
```


![Features of cells](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/ab9175bc-8916-47a7-b74e-c9740ddad546)

You can infer that .lib contains information about area number,leakage power,powerport.

It also describes each input combination,i.e., 32 combinations for 5 inputs:

>The power related to that input pin.

>the transition related to that pin.

>The delay related to that pin.

<details> <summary>Hierarchical Synthesis vs Flat Synthesis</summary>


**Hierarchiacal Synthesis:**
It refers to a design methodology where a complex digital circuit is created by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable modules or blocks. Each module is designed and synthesized separately, and then these modules are integrated hierarchically to create the complete circuit.


**Example:**

To get a better understanding of this hierarchical synthesis we shall synthesize a design file named multiple modules.


**Multiples Modules:**

To view the file move to the verilog_file directory:

```
cd VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/
gvim multiple_modules.v
```
![multiple module](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/4b2b5f3c-0a7a-4d69-92ea-8f39df7dbb6e)



From the verilog file what we realize is the image shown below :

![multiple modules 1](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/2b6ce52a-258a-43e6-a05b-1b55047b70a3)


Now lets synthesize the verilog file using yosys,

To synthesize:

```
yosys
read_verilog multiple_modules.v
synth -top multiple_modules
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
show multiple_modules 
```
*since there are several modules present specify the name along with the show command.*



![yosys show](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/3a09410c-ca34-4a37-873f-fd7dfb2251f8)




Now from the image you can clearly see that it is not showing **and** and **or** gate.It is showing u1 and u2 instances of submodule1 and submodule2.This is called as the hierarchical design.

Now we shall write out the netlist and see how the netlist looks like,

```
write_verilog multiple_modules_hier.v
!gvim multiple_modules_hier.v
```

![netlist](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/ee5ef68a-9b8f-4909-8c91-b048ee7f309d)


In submodule2 we are expecting an or gate but what happening in yosys synthesis is shown in the below image:



![Nand nor](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/68093c8a-f5ff-42a6-90c6-61fc96bd8f0e)

As we can infer from the above image the yosys synhtesize a nand logic.The nand logic contains a stacked nmos where as nor logic contains stacked pmos.The stacked pmos is always bad because the pmos has poor mobility. To improve this we have to make this cell really a wide cell to get good logical circuit which requires more area.This can impact the overall chip area and potentially reduce the number of gates that can be integrated onto a chip.


**Flat Synthesis:**
It is the opposite of hierarchical synthesis in the context of digital design, particularly in RTL (Register Transfer Level) design. While hierarchical synthesis involves breaking down a complex design into smaller modules and then integrating them hierarchically, flat synthesis refers to synthesizing the entire design as a single, monolithic unit without using hierarchical module decomposition.

To view the netlist for the flattened synthesis:

```
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v
gvim multiple_modules_flat.v
```


![Flatten](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/2ee50214-ff14-4c55-9b48-80c06ee1adf8)

![flat show](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/23ab7929-a5dc-4d2f-882c-59509f6f2d7e)



You can infer from the image that it has single netlist.The hierarchies are flattened out.We candirectly see the instantiation of and and or gates.

**Synthesization of submodules:**

To synthesise submodule:


```

yosys
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
read_verilog 
read_verilog multiple_modules.v 
synth -top sub_module1
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

**Why submodule level synth?**

1.When have multiple instances of same module we can synthesise it one time and replicate it multiple times and stitch it together in the top module.

2.**Divide and Conquer:** When we give massive design to a tool,the tool may not be doing a good job.Instead we give portions of the massive design so a nice netlist is written out and synthesizedand finally stitched together in the topmodule.

  <summary>
    Various Flop Coding Styles and optimization 
  </summary>

**Why Flipflops?**


![Why flops](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/99f1748a-c22c-4094-8dbc-b939c2330d6a)

In RTL, flip-flops can be used to control the flow of data and operations in a circuit. For instance, they can hold  signals that determine whether certain operations or data transfers should occur so the glitches can be reduced then the output becomes settled down.Eventhough the input of the flop is glitching the output will be stable.

**D flipflop with async reset:**
A D flip-flop operates on clock edges. It captures the value of the D input on the rising edge of the clock.Asynchronous Reset  input allows you to reset the flip-flop's state to 0 regardless of the clock signal

Now we shall simulate and synthesize the D-FF:

**Simulation:**

Verilog code:

```
 module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
	always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
	begin
		if(async_reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else	
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule
```

**Optimization:**

In this lab we will see optimization of circuits without using any hardware.We shall take an example of multiplier 2.

![mul2](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/170e61bb-69cf-4d48-932f-d9badc252ce9)




From the image we can clearly see that the output is nothing but input appended with a zero.So there is no need of any additional hardware.

Verilog code:

```
module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2;
endmodule
```

Lets synthesize this verilog design using yosys,

![mult_2](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/11d4acdb-cb08-4b5d-aa78-0ae4206b7dcb)

Now we shall take another examole of multiplier of 9:

Verilog code:

```
module mult8 (input [2:0] a , output [5:0] y);
	assign y = a * 9;
endmodule
```

Why logic optimization?

 Optimizing RTL designs involves enhancing various aspects of the design to achieve better performance, reduced power consumption, and improved area utilization.
 This optimization can be achieved by synthesis tool by using different techniques.

Techniques:


1.Constant Propagation

~Direct optimization

2.Boolean logic optimization

~K map

~Queen Mckluskey


**Constant propagation:**

![example1](https://github.com/IIITB-ARUL/IIITB-MT2023529/assets/140998631/10109081-25f0-400f-8d60-ea6123ac25bb)


CMOS logic of the above design,

From the image we can observe that the number of transistors deployed to realize the same expression is decreased.

**Boolean logic optimization:**

From the image we infer that the long complex expression is reduced to a simple expression using kmap reduction.Here the boolean logic optimization is done by the synthesis tool.

**Sequential logic optimization:**

1.Basic

~Sequential constant propagation

2.Advanced 

~State optimization

~Retiming

~Sequential logic cloning(Floor plane aware synthesis)
